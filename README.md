# Hermez

This repository contains a **Flutter-based Android application** that integrates
with **Firebase Authentication** and **Firebase Database**. The project
implements user login and data interaction via Firebase APIs, and represents my
experience building and integrating mobile applications with cloud-based
backend services.

Original repository: https://github.com/AliceMochi/Hermez-Delivery-App

Hermez is a **mobile delivery-style application** inspired by the Greek
mythology figure **Hermes**, the messenger god known for speed and mobility.
The name reflects the core idea of fast delivery, while the visual theme
uses **gold accents** inspired by Hermes’ winged boots.

This application was developed using **Flutter** and integrates **Firebase**
services for authentication and data storage. The project focuses on mobile
application development and cloud-based backend integration, and is maintained
as part of my professional GitHub portfolio.

## App Concept
Hermez is designed as a delivery-style application concept, emphasizing speed,
simplicity, and accessibility. The branding is inspired by Greek mythology,
using gold tones and wing motifs to represent fast and reliable movement.
